                <p>
                    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
                    and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                    foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
                    in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                    and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power
                    of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
                    pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the
                    claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
                    repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this
                    principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
                    pains to avoid worse pains."
